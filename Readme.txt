ZX Spectrum 128k version 
   @salvaKantero 2016


As every year, our chief proposes a motor race with which to implement our mechanical knowledge acquired at the garage. The prize is an extra payment. 
This time you did your homework and you built a car in your spare time that has nothing to envy to a F1!
But the stages that you have to overcome have been located and designed to try the patience of the fastest drivers.
Run over the help tiles you find on your way with your car to obtain the necessary assistance during the game.
Good luck… and run!

Scoreboard
